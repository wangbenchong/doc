# 光线追踪课堂笔记

- 屏幕上的像素点可以理解为从眼睛发出的光
- 更高效的方式是只计算从眼睛到达物体表面的光

```c
float4 frag(v2f i) : SV_Target
{
    float3 viewPointLocal = float3(i.uv - 0.5, 1) * viewParams;
    float viewPoint = mul(CamLocalToWorldMatrix, float4(viewPointLocal, 1));
    
    Ray ray;
    ray.origin = _WorldSpaceCameraPos;
    ray.dir = normalize(viewPoint - ray.origin);
    return CalculateRayCollision(ray).material.color;
}
```

## 光追漫反射

- 随机产生反射向量（一个像素一个值， 灰度图）
- 随机产生反射向量（一个像素三个值，rgb）
- 用随机值作为小球表面的向量

```c
//Calculate random direction using rejection sampling
float3 RandomDirection(intout uint state)
{
    float x = RandomValue(state) * 2 -1;//将0~1映射到-1~1
    float y = RandomValue(state) * 2 -1;
    float z = RandomValue(state) * 2 -1;;
    float3 pointInCube = float3(x, y, z);
    return normalize(pointInCube);
}
```

- 将代码应用到球体上发现密度不均，密度高的集中在中心Y字形区域。
- 改用正态分布
- 如果随机生成的反射方向和法线相背。则取反。

## 光追代码框架

```c
//Trace the path of a ray og light(in reverse)as it travels from the camera.
//reflects off objects in the scene, and ends up(hopefully) at a light source.
flout3 Trace(Ray ray, inout uint rngState)
{
    for(int i=0;i<=MaxBounceCount; i++)//max bounces越大，反弹次数越大，效果越好
    {
        HidInfo hitInfo = CalculateRayCollision(ray);
        if(hitInfo.didHit)
        {
            ray.origin = hitInfo.hitPoint;
            Ray.dir = RandomHemisphereDirection(hitInfo.normal, rngState);
        }
        else
        {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```



- 设置其中一个物体为光源（物体颜色为黑，自发光为白）C#脚本测试光追

- 如何获得更平滑、低噪的结果
- 增大MaxBounceCount
- 如何在获得更平滑结果的同时，保持光追性能
- 光追如何支持环境光（加上天空盒一起算）
- 考虑灯光照射角度衰减（斜照覆盖面积大，等量光线越稀疏）
- 正面贡献更多光照，侧面更少
- 光追镜面反射

```c
//计算反弹光线方向
float3 dirOut = dirIn - 2 * dot(dirIn, normal) * normal;
```

- 光追镜面反射对的颜色
- 镜面反射不同于漫反射，反射光更近于白光。漫反射则是根据材质颜色反光。
- 比如西红柿，半透明表皮，穿透表皮的进行漫反射，没穿透表皮的进行镜面反射。
- 光追模糊效果
- 抗锯齿效果（边缘模糊）
- 光追景深
- 偏移摄像机原点并向同一像素发出多束光线，取其平均

Some notes:
• I made a little build where you can play with the atmosphere settings yourself, which you can find over here if you're interested: http://nishitalab.org/user/nis/cdrom/sig93_nis.pdf

• A number of knowledgeable people have pointed out in the comments that reality is not nearly as simple as my little diagram around the 4 and a half minute mark, and that light does not literally wiggle up and down like a wave, so please note that the diagram is incorrect!

• This project was inspired by the game Outer Wilds, which I highly recommend playing!

## Coding Adventure: Terraforming

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMEdHcKgM4&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ehjAfLFsp1PGaatzAwo0uK&index=6
I got a bit tired of my simple heightmap-based planets and decided to experiment with generating them using the Marching Cubes algorithm instead, so that I could add a 'terraforming' ability for shaping the world with caves and tunnels and so on. I hope you enjoy!
